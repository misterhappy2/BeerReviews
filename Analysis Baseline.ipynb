That's not terrible; it's much better than random guessing, and better than guessing IPA (which would yield precision 1.00, recall 0.13.)  <br> Some classes have very little data, according to the support number.  These often have lower scores, such as American Dark Wheat Ale:     precision 1.00    recall 0.12     F1 0.22     support 16.   Black & Tan: precision   1.00  recall  0.12    F1  0.22    support  8.  Each B&T prediction was correct, but we missed most of them.   Biere Brut got a zero score.  <br>  Classes with more support generally scored better:  American IPA F1 0.49, American Double IPA F1 0.51, Saison F1 0.51.  <br>  Pumpkin ale wins with F1 0.71!  It didn't have a lot of support.  This style is distinct, so perhaps the reviews were consistent and unique from other styles.    \n",

Stout F1 score remained the same.  <br>  I improved the baseline by reducing number of classes.  I hope to improve the scores much more.  I'll eliminate imbalance, use feature engineering, tune the algorithm, and try different algorithms.  In the end, I hope that my algorithm will predict style from text with accuracy.  Perhaps I'll try to use the improved algorithm on the entire set of classes.  "
